# Technology stack explained

## Best Practises

* added **.gitignore** to store only necessary files in git
* **docker** wasn't used as it will be added as a part of 2nd lab task
* used **JUnit5** framework for tests
* followed best practises for package structure

## Java framework

For this particular project I have chosen **Spring** framework with its project **SpringBoot**

### Pros

* Spring Framework can be employed on all architectural layers used in the development of web applications
* Uses the very lightweight POJO model when writing classes
* Allows you to freely link modules and easily test them
* Supports declarative programming
* Eliminates the need to independently create factory and singleton classes
* Supports various configuration methods
* Provides middleware-level service

### Cons

* Lack of control. Spring Boot creates a lot of unused dependencies, resulting in a large deployment file
* The complex and time-consuming process of converting a legacy or an existing Spring project to a Spring Boot application
* Not suitable for large-scale projects. Although itâ€™s great for working with microservices, many developers claim that Spring Boot is not suitable for building monolithic applications

## Linting

### Java code

For this project I used **Sonarlint** linter which can be added as a plugin to all popular java IDEs

### Markdown

As **Markdown linter** I used pycharm plugin **Markdown**
